# diffuse-gamma-ray
This repository houses the code used to analyze diffuse gamma-ray data taken with the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope. We use it to look at properties of:

1. the interstellar medium (ISM) and
2. diffuse cosmic-ray sea

throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.

The code is currently split up into a handful of modules, and it is not obvious how to use it. I will refactor the code so it is more readable and useable.
